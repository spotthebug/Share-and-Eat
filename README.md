# Share-and-Eat

Share-and-Eat is a web application that allows users to order food from different restaurants. 

### So what is different about Share Eats?
It allows users to Pay it forward, meaning that users can buy meal for the homeless and needy. Anyone in need of food can walk in the restaurant and pick up the food paid forward by generous users like you.

### MVP:
- An About Page that gives users instructions on using the Website, information about the appâ€™s mission and why they should be using the app
- A Homepage that displays all the restaurants that a user can order from
- User can click on the restaurant of choice and see details about their menu
- On the Menu page, the user will be able to select the items and specify the quantity
- Once user has confirmed the order, a confirmation message will display on the page 
- User will have to sign up /login to be able to order food through the app

### Stretch Goals:
- Implement Payment functionality using Stripe / Apple Pay / Android Pay
- Send text or email notification confirming the order details
- Integrating Google Maps API, so that user can conveniently find directions to the restaurant through the app
- Provide seperate login functionality for admin
